## Week 1

### Day 1 â€“ Hello World
**Goal:**  
Start with HTML + JavaScript basics.

**What the exercise does:**  
- Shows a "Hello, World!" heading on the page.  
- One button logs a message to the console **and** updates the page text.  
- Another button updates the page text directly.  

**What I practiced:**  
- Writing minimal HTML5 structure.  
- Using `<script>` to run JavaScript.  
- `console.log()` for debugging.  
- Accessing elements with `document.getElementById()`.  
- Updating text on the page with `.textContent`.  
- Handling button clicks with `onclick`.
